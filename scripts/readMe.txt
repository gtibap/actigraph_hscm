visual_mat_act_thigh.py
for the experiments with the pressure mattress and only one actigraph attached to a thigh.

pressure_selected_pixel_thigh.py
same as the previous one but without annotations.

groups_activity_7.py
It plots actigraphy data (e.i. Vector Magnitude and inclinometers), a stems plot that shows spending times of motor activity and inactivity (two scales, two colors, in the same plot). Interactive mouse selection on the stems plot to generate the corresponding plot of the actigraphy data.

groups_activity_statistics.py (last updated: April 11, 2023)
It calculates total number of motor-activity units in bed (Inclinometer Off==True); to be part of a motor-activity unit each Vector Magnitude (VM) sample has to be greater than 3 counts; additionally, VM samples included in the same motor-activity unit have a time difference less than 10s to the nearest included sample.

rw_mattress_data.py
reads .csv files of the pressure mattress generated by Tactilus software and writes the data using numpy to facilitate data visualization with matplotlib. This process generates two files: one header (.csv) and one raw (.npz)).

plot_inclinometers_class.py
We define a Class called 'Actigraphy' to facilitate simultaneous visualization of chest and thigh collected actigraphy. Additionally, we represent inclinometers' information with stems. This script reads inclinometers information (off, lyi, sit, sta) and creates a DataFrame including columns with the following information: incl, id_ini, id_end, duration, night. It is worth to mention that among the inclinometers, only one at a time is active in a 1s epocs.

plot_vec_mag_class.py
Simultaneously, plotting of actigraphy chest and thigh per night; additionally, highlighthing activity regions following Vector Magnitude data and two conditions: Vector Magnitude greater than a 'min_value' and consecutive activity samples with a distance less than 'min_gap' are considered part of the same group of activity.
